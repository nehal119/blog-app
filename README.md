## Building a Blog App  using Node and Express

This application was built with `Node` and `Express`. It also uses other technologies like `MongoDB` as a database and `Semantic-UI` for user interface design.
In this application a user can upload an `image` with a `title` and `description` which will be saved in the database and can be seen on the homepage.
